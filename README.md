# 1. <a name="user-ex">User Experience</a>
## A user visiting the website would expect the following:
- To find it easy to understand the purpose of the website.
- To easily navigate the website through it's contents.
- To find information on the things to do in the town of Folkestone
- To find information on the places to eat.

<br><br>

## Design Approach
- The reason why I chose this design for the website is because it's simplicity. Users spend a matter of seconds on a website before they decide if this is the place for them or not. 

- Visit Folkestone presents its information quickly and it allowes the users to find the location of where each picture was taken by clicking on each picture, whilst redirecting them to an exact location on Google Maps.

- The pictures on the website were taken by me, and I have kept the picture cropping to a minimum. The reason behind this is to allow the user to experience the highest quality so that they can immerse themselvs in the experience. I believe that this is an important decisive factor if a user wants to visit the town of Folkestone.

- The primary purpose of the website is to attract visitors.

## Navigation ![Navigation bar](assets/images/readme_img/nav_bar.png)

- The Navigation bar features a Lighthouse as the Logo of the Page, the main title "Visit Folkestone" and the 3 navigation tabs. 
- The navigation tabs are: HOME | TOWN TOUR | CONTACT and each tab will take you to different pages on the website.
- The Navigation bar has an .active and .hover feature. 
- The background colour sample of the navigation tabs was sampled using a Chrome web browser extension called Eye Dropper. The colour was picked from the sky in the main banner picture in the landing page to establish a colour scheme. 
- The picture logo was custom made by using an online tool called [Brand Crowd](https://www.brandcrowd.com/).

## External Links Section ![Links Section Image](assets/images/readme_img/Links_Section.png)
- The External Links section is made of four links which redirect the user to different websites depending on their interest. Clicking on any of the links will open a new tab to an external website. The background colour for each title tag was set in a way that it contrast with the white writing for the best user experience.
These four links are:

- Chrome Developer Tools Lighthouse. The Performance is in the amber zone due the the picture sizes. Visit Folkestone is a website designed to attract visitors so the aim is for the pictures to be as clear and high definition as possible to entice people to come over. The Website still performes well.
